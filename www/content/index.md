Hello there! Welcome to my website. I am a final year Computer Science student at Bayero University, Kano. I am interesting in Backend Development and Machine Learning especially with languages like Go and TypeScript. I love to write. You can check out some of my work at [Make Use Of](https://muo.com/author/david-uzondu).

## Projects

Here's some of the most important things I have worked on over the years.

- ### spaces-dl
A dead simple Twitter Spaces downloader. I built it while I was learning TypeScript. The code is super ugly, but hey it works. You can check it out on NPM.

- ### OTMS
An Online Test Management System. This was my final year project. I had lots of fun building it. The frontend is built with Next.js and the backend runs on Nest.js
